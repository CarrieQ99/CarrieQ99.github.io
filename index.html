        <i style = "font-size:20px">Close your eyes and imagine the archetypal cat. A cobby, four-square cat ..…... a people cat ..…... a "companion" cat ....... a lap-cat ....... and occasionally "I’ll sit on your lap when I feel like it, thank you!!” cat ....... a purring machine on short sturdy legs ....... a "teddy-bear” cat ....... in fact, the feline friend for life.</i>

Olga is the one who started Feliland … She brought her first female Lissy from Austria in 2009 and just couldn't help but fell in love with her aqua eyes and her sweet and aristocratic personality. Anna has joined Olga in 2011. The biggest helpers are Tatyana – Olga's daughter and Diana and Sarah – Anna's daughters.
